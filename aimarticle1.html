                As competitive gaming was on the rise, Kovaak’s Aim Trainer launched in 2017. 
                Its goal was to help aspiring competitive gamers improve their aim at a faster rate. 
                Before this software, gamers would improve their aim through their respective games. 
                However, if you think of it, in a normal CSGO match, 90% of the time is spent watching flanks, 
                setting up smokes and holding angles. Very little time is spent engaging in gunfights. 
                With Kovaak’s Aim Trainer, competitive gaming has been brought to another level. 
                With their specific exercises such as <strong>1wall6targets</strong>, <strong>1wall 5targets_pasu</strong>, <strong>RexStrafesCata</strong>, 
                and <strong>voxTargetSwitch</strong>, cover each aiming movement a player will ever encounter in a competitive match. 
                These exercises will prepare the player for any type of gunfight, whether the gamer will perform a tracking movement,
                flicking motion, or target switch motion. However, some exercises in Kovaak's do not improve aim, 
                they are just there for amusement purposes such as <strong>Tile Frenzy</strong>.

                The best way to get full results, is to follow a routine. 
                In 2017, one of the best FPS coaches, named Aimer7,  
                wrote a guide to help gamers achieve full potential in this aim trainer. This guide was separated into sections, 
                or levels ranging from complete beginner, 
                all the way to sub aim beasts. These levels were separated into three branches, 
                tracking based routine, where the majority of exercises are tracking scenarios, 
                click-timing routines where most of the motions in the tasks are flicks, 
                and complete routines, which is best for both worlds. This 15 page thesis received 
                a lot of acclaim from gamers who attempted to try the routine for 30 days. However, in the next few years, 
                Kovaak’s grew in popularity and many people started to create their own scenarios. To this day, 8500+ scenarios 
                have been implemented into Kovaak’s. Aimer7’s guide became obsolete and outdated. New routines started to come out. 
                Often nicknamed as Aimer7’s guide 2.0, the Tammas Routine Addendum was released in 2020. 
                This routine is similar to Aimer7’s guide, however with several additions such as new scenarios.

                Kovaak’s Aim Trainer is recognized as the best aim trainer in gaming due to its challenging scenarios 
                and applicability in specific situations. 
                The variety of scenarios in this software is mind-blowing.
