                Meet Kovaak 2.0’s biggest competitor: Aim Lab developed by State Space Labs. 
                Released in 2020, this aim training software grew in popularity extremely quickly because it is free-to-play. 
                The developers of this game opted for a friendly, and an arcade styled user interface which attracted many users. 
                Aim Lab is currently in beta testing and is at approximately 60% complete. Aim Lab has gained many followers since 
                its release. AimLab has sponsored many gamers in order to promote their game such as aimgod Tenz. 
                World-renowned gaming company, Ubisoft, has also partnered with Aimlab in order to bring Rainbow Six Siege 
                styled exercises to Aimlab.

                Aim Lab features many exercises focusing on tracking, precision, target switching, microflicks, flicks, 
                decision making and reaction time. Their most played tasks are <strong>Gridshot, Spidershot, Sixshot, Microshot, 
                Circletrack and Switchtrack</strong>. One of the most interesting features of Aim Lab is their AI based training. 
                Their AI tracks the user’s progress and explains their weaknesses and strengths. In addition, the AI will 
                place the targets in areas that the player struggles with. For example, left side weakness, or bottom screen 
                weakness. Their interactive videos are also very helpful. Aim Lab also allows users to create their own scenarios 
                thanks to Unity, a powerful game development engine.  Another fantastic feature is their sensitivity options. 
                Games have different sensitivities and it is very difficult to convert sensitivity from game to game. Fortunately, 
                Aim Lab does this for you. Just select the game you want in the sensitivity bar, and you can adjust from there. 
            </p>

                In conclusion, if you are looking to start aim training and improve your skills without paying a single cent,
                Aim Lab is for you. Its incredible AI, fun scenarios, and interactive user interface will help you improve in 
                your respective game.
