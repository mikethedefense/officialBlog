                Rainbow Six: Siege Year 6 should be an exciting one. 
                New operator balancing will definitely change some of the meta in place.
                Here is a detailed description of the Y6S1.3 Designer Notes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The first change occurs with the operator Ace. Ubisoft will replace smoke grenades with a claymore. 
                The S.E.L.M.A now destroys Mira’s gadget. The reason for these changes is to make Ace more present in Ranked matches. 
                Ubisoft is clearly trying to make him a primary hard breacher. His ability to counter should augment his presence and 
                win delta in competitive Siege games. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, Jackal’s C7E is getting an ammo and damage nerf. His magazine capacity is getting reduced to 
                25+1 bullets (formerly 30+1). The gun’s damage is getting reduced to 42, from 46. 
                Ubisoft is targeting his gun as Jackal is not very present in Ranked matches as he gets banned all the time. 
                This is mainly due to his ability, but his gun also represents one of his strengths as an operator. 
                This nerf also gives players the option to choose his PDW9. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, this change is probably the biggest change in this list. One of Siege’s most used operators is 
                getting a nerf. Jager is extremely present throughout ranked matches as he can counter extremely important 
                attacker utility such as Ash’s breach charge, grenades, Zofia’s gadget and Fuze’s gadget. 
                This nerf will certainly reduce his presence and reduce his win delta. Jager’s 416-C is getting 
                a vertical recoil nerf and Ubisoft Montreal will decrease the gun’s ammo capacity to 25+1 (was 30+1). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Siege’s biggest meme is receiving a buff. The Tachanka Shumikha is getting an increase in mag capacity from 5 to 7. 
                The fire duration will be increased from 5s to 7s. It will have a reduced detonation time, 
                increased fire radius and also increased projectile speed. His gun, the DP27 is getting a reduced equip time 
                and also unequip time. As Lord Tachanka got his rework, speculation suggested that he would be overpowered. 
                However, current data shows that his win delta and presence are far below expectations, thus generating the need 
                to buff him again. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The last change on this list is to Thermite. Ubisoft seems to be trying to make Thermite as a secondary hard breacher 
                by replacing his claymore with smokes. Ubisoft wants Thermite to impact the late game execution. 
            </p>
